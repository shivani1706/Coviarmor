    <h1>WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER VACCINATION?</h1>
    <img src="../assets/afterVaccination.png" alt="" style="width: 35%; float: right;">
    <div style="float: left; width: 65%;"></div>

    <button class="accordion">Do I need to use the mask/other COVID-19 appropriate precautions after receiving the
        vaccine?<span style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Yes, it is absolutely necessary that everyone who has received the COVID-19 vaccine should continue to follow
            the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour i.e., mask, do gaj ki doori and hand sanitization to protect themselves
            and those around from spreading the infection.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">How long I will remain protected after vaccination?<span
            style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Longevity of the immune response in vaccinated individuals is yet to be determined. Hence, continuing the use
            of masks, handwashing, physical distancing and other COVID-19 appropriate behaviours is strongly
            recommended.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Does vaccination protect me against newer strains / mutated virus of SARS-CoV 2?<span
            style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The body responds to vaccination by making more than one type of antibodies to virus parts including spike
            protein. Therefore, all vaccines are expected to provide reasonable amount of protection against the mutated
            virus also. Based on the available data the mutations as reported are unlikely to make the vaccine
            ineffective.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">In how many days will the vaccination create an adequate immune response and
        protection?<span style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Adequate immune response takes 2-3 weeks after completion of entire vaccination schedule i.e., after the
            second dose of COVISHIELD® and COVAXIN®.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Should you avoid alcohol after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine?<span
            style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>As per experts, there is no evidence of alcohol impairing the effectiveness of the vaccine.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What precautions I need to take after receiving the vaccine?<span
            style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Both the vaccines are safe but in case of any discomfort or complaint, ask the beneficiary to visit the
            nearest health facility and/or call the health worker whose phone number is given in the Co-WIN SMS received
            after vaccination.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Is it important for me to receive the same vaccine during second dose?<span style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>As the vaccines available are not interchangeable, it is important to receive the second dose of same vaccine as the first one. The Co-WIN portal is also going to help to ensure that everyone receives the same vaccine.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Does this vaccine provide herd immunity?<span style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>When an increasing number of people get vaccinated in the community, indirect protection through herd immunity develops. The percentage of people who need to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity varies with each disease. For example, its 95% for measles, however the proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to begin inducing herd immunity is not known.</p>
