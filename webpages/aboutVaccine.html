            Organization (CDSCO) in India are Covishield® (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of
            India) and Covaxin® (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited).</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Is it mandatory to take the vaccine?<span style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of COVID-19
            vaccine for protecting oneself against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the
