    <h1>WHAT TO EXPECT BEFORE VACCINATION?</h1>

    <button class="accordion">What does trial mode mean for a vaccine recipient?<span
            style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The way we do in a clinical trial phase: first, the recipient will be asked to give a written consent.
            Additionally, the recipient will be followed up actively to see if the vaccine has led to any side effects.
            In short, it will be an extension of the Phase 3 trial. But in this, the person would know that he or she
            has received the vaccine, and not the placebo. It is completely voluntary.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What is the safety and efficacy of the vaccines used in the country?<span
            style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>To ensure that a vaccine is safe, we need to try it on a large number of people. The vaccine developers have
            not reduced the sample size at any stage of clinical trials rather it was bigger than what we usually test a
            vaccine on.

            When a vaccine is tested, most of the adverse events or unwanted effects, if any, occur in the first four to
            six weeks of its administration. So, in order to ensure that it is safe, we keep a close watch, for the
            first two-three months, on the people it has been given to. This data help us decide if a vaccine is safe.
            All concerned in the line of vaccine development, testing and evaluation have followed these procedures to
            the T. Both Indian vaccines are considered safe on this yardstick.

            As for the efficacy of the vaccine, we need time to tell how effective a vaccine is. All the global agencies
            have set the benchmark that only those vaccine candidates which show an efficacy of at least 50-60% will be
            considered. Most of the vaccines have shown an efficacy of 70-90% within the short period of two to three
            months of observation. Besides when a vaccine is given an emergency use authorizations/permission for
            restricted use, as in the case of the COVID-19 vaccine, the trial follow-up continues for one-two years to
            assess the total duration of protection the vaccine will provide.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Which vaccine is better between Covisheild and Covaxin?<span
            style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>There is no head-to-head comparison done between the two vaccines being used in India so one cannot choose
            one over the other. Both would work fine in preventing the infection as well as prevent a person from going
            into severe state of the disease. As a long-term effect, it would be preventing death for elderly people or
            those who have comorbidities.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What medications should be avoided before taking COVID-19 vaccine and for how long?<span
            style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Currently, there is no such instruction. One can take oneâ€™s regular medication uninterruptedly. Just inform
            the vaccinator about the medicines you consume.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Is the vaccine contraindicated in person with chronic diseases?<span
            style="float: right;">&#43;</span></button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Chronic diseases and morbidities like the cardiac, neurological, pulmonary, metabolic, renal and malignancies
            etc. are not contraindicated. In fact, the benefit of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the risk of severe
            COVID-19 disease and death is for those who have these comorbidities.</p>
